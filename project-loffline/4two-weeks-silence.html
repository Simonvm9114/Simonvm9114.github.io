        <h1>Two weeks of silence</h1>
        <h6>Project Loffline</h6>

        <p>It's been over two weeks since I started Project Loffline. A nice milestone to share some of the highs and
            lows with you. If you are in the middle of it and are wondering what the hell this is about, <a
                class='link-in-article' href="1pilot.html">click here to start at the beginning<i
                    class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-xs"></i></a>.</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-right">Getting up on time has been a lot easier for me in the last few weeks</p>
        <p>Maybe I am going crazy and this has nothing to do with my experiment, but the craziest experience in the last
            two weeks was that one day I woke up... at 5:00 in the morning. I had gone to bed at 11:00 p.m. because I
            had a meeting at 9:30 a.m. When I was still awake at 5:45 a.m. I just got out of bed. I did some things that
            I would otherwise have had to do after the meeting. I wasn't tired for the rest of the day, until it was
            time to go to bed again. Getting up early has never been my thing and nothing like this had ever happened to
            me before. Getting up on time has been a lot easier for me in the last few weeks. Of course I would like to
            link this to my experiment. A possible explanation is that when I used my phone, I sometimes did this when I
            was doing something else simultaniously. While I was talking to someone, while I was cycling, while I was
            studying. I can imagine that constantly switching between the phone and another activity takes a lot of
            energy, energy that I often save now.</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-left">"I thought, I'll text him, but that slipped my mind"</p>
        <p>So, what about communication. A week ago I had a party for someone's birthday. Just before I left home, I
            realized that I had nothing to give. I hadn't heard from anyone about a joint gift either. You guessed it,
            there was something organized, but this was discussed through a group chat. They forgot about me. "I
            thought, I'll text him, but that slipped my mind". That was the explanation that I got. Anyway, fortunately
            It was possible for me to make a contribution last minute. Despite the fact that I found this kind of group
            chats useful, I also like to see the positive side of this situation. In a previous blog I already described
            that the use of a phone according to my hypothesis can lead to a "lazy memory". I will probably have to take
            more initiative for these kinds of occasions now. I expect that in the long run this will lead to a better
            memory of the upcoming activities that I have and thus to better preparation for as well.</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-right">...about 10 messages back and forth could not lead to a really clear appointment</p>
        <p>How do I communicate now? You might not guess it, but I have been using the sms again since two weeks! Super
            old-fashioned, but very effective. Most conversations consist of asking a question with an answer in return.
            Or, for example, to confirm an appointment. Up until now, things haven't always been going so well every
            time. The first sms conversation since I've been without Whatsapp, was in my opinion super awkward. I had to
            make a quick appointment with someone where we would meet each other while walking. That didn't work out
            very well. Ever-changing plans, also depending on some environmental factors, did not help at all and about
            10 messages back and forth could not lead to a really clear appointment. I think it would have been a lot
            easier to make a phone call. I do think that this is a typical consequence of the continuous accessibility
            that we enjoy nowadays. Because we assume that we can always reach each other, we wait until the very last
            minute to make good arrangements.</p>
        <p>In my search for the most practical and minimal use of my phone, I have perhaps also made some mistakes with
            my texting over the past few weeks. My messages were pretty formal and if I knew what I needed to know I
            wouldn't answer anymore. I got the feedback that a thank you would be nice. I will try to do better in the
            future!</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-left">Using your phone all the time doesn't really invite to start a conversation</p>
        <p>It was two weeks of highs and lows. There were irritations. One afternoon when I was chilling with a friend,
            I thought he was checking his phone all the time. He happened to be chatting with a nice girl and I don't
            think he left a moment untouched to pay attention to that conversation. I noticed that I found this rather
            annoying. My phone was well tucked inside my pocket and where I tried to use it as little as possible, I
            felt like he was only using it more and more. Luckily I have the self-control of an old Zen master and I
            first checked with myself whether this could be my own fault, before I discussed this with my friend.
            Probably I am used to pick up my phone when someone else does, but now that I don't really have any reason
            to do so anymore, I'm bothered by it when someone else uses his phone a lot. I do find that using your phone
            doesn't really invite to start a conversation. So if you don't want to put my self-control to the test, just
            put your phone somewhere where the sun isn't shining when I'm around.</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-right">Suddenly I understand the usefulness that women see in a handbag</p>
        <p>A very positive side effect of my experiment is that many people ask me how I like it without Whatsapp. So I
            almost always have a subject for discussion. In my first blog I also indicated that I will try to leave my
            phone at home at least once a week when I leave the house myself. I do and I really like it. There are
            several times in the week when I really don't need my phone. Even more often I leave my phone in my jacket
            when I'm visiting someone. The jacket is hanging on the coat rack and I don't have my phone with me. For me
            this is actually a simple trick not to grab my phone too quickly. I'm surprised that I've never thought of
            this before, because I don't like a phone in my pocket at all. I don't know how I'm going to solve this
            later in the summer when I don't have to wear a jacket anymore. Suddenly I understand the usefulness that
            women see in a handbag.</p>
        <p>That remark from the phone where the sun isn't shining, that's a joke, of course. Forcing my ideals on
            someone else is the last thing I want. Although I do think for the fact that together is always better than
            alone. If, as a reader, you feel inspired by Project Loffline, I would like to invite you to join me. In
            doing so, I would like to emphasize once again the general idea: to return to the most practical use of
            smartphones. Your view on practical use may differ from mine. In other words, I do not expect the same
            measures as I am taking. So if you notice that you are grabbing your phone a little more often than you
            would like, please contact me. I would like to exchange ideas and think along with you about what you could
            do about it!</p>
