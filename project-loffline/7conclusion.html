            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <h6>Project Loffline</h6>

            <p>On the 20th of October 2015 I started Project Loffline. Meanwhile, almost 5 months later, I think it is time to draw up the final conclusions and "end" the project. In this blog I’ll describe what it has brought me and how to proceed. I deliberately write ending in quotation marks. The project has drastically changed the way I use my smartphone and that will be permanent. So it is not really possible to speak of ending. Ending in this case means that after this post, I will not write new blogs under the guise of this project.</p>
            <p class = "blog-quote-right">If you need something from me now, please just call me right away</p>
            <p>So what about The idea’s behind part 3? Yes, you I owe you that one. In part 3 I would discribe which values I find important where I think the excessive use of a smartphone is not complementary. While describing this part of the project, I came to the conclusion that this involves much more than I thought. I think I could write a book about what I find important and how I would like to organize my life. Dealing with modern technology and therefore also mobile phones is only a fraction of that. As far as this project is concerned, I must therefore still owe you this part for a while and I won’t make a statement as to when I will be doing this.</p>
            <p>So, project Loffline, the final balance. Let me start with Whatsapp. The fact that I removed Whatsapp from my phone has given me a lot of nice discussions about whether it is useful or not. I can tell you: A life without Whatsapp is possible. However I did decide to start using Whatsapp again. I even want to give some group chats a chance again. For a long time I had planned not to do this, so why was it? Quite unsatisfactory maybe, but it’s just because it’s there. Whatsapp has quite some more options than the SMS to express yourself. It’s also a bit more user-friendly. For example, I missed using the all the emoticons. The intention is to continue to use Whatsapp as practically as how I now use the SMS: Super handy when I (or you) have a question that can be answered tomorrow, but if you need something from me now, please just call me right away. If I’m not available, to bad for you. In short: I focus on practical use.</p>
            <p class = "blog-quote-left">No social media platform should ever get in between real social contact</p>
            <p>Aside from the way I communicate with others via my phone, I actually learned something much more important when dealing with that thing, namely simply not looking at it at certain moments. Whenever I am at a birthday party, doing something with friends, sitting on the couch with my girlfriend, my phone is in my pocket. That I receive a call can happen sometime, but in my opinion a text message, Facebook, snapchat or name any social media platform should never get in between "real" social contact. Occasionally nice for the free time alone, but that’s it. Furthermore, I am still not available for about an hour before I go to sleep and an hour after I wake up, with some exceptions, and occasionally I leave my phone at home. In that regard, no shocking changes or experiences during the last months and I will continue to do so. I just like it.</p>
            <p>After my experiment I would like to advise everyone to use your smartphone consciously. That does not necessarily mean that you should do the same as I did. What I want to say is; be aware of what the use of your mobile phone does to you and your attention for anything that happens around you. Whether you are a woman or a man, doing two things at once with your full attention is simply impossible. Our brains are not made for that.</p>
            <p class = "blog-quote-right">Doing two things at once is simply not possible</p>
            <p>That’s it for Project Loffline. For those who enjoy reading my blogs; no worries. I love to write about my experiences and opinions in life and therefore I have a new theme to write about for the coming period: The (or my) use of alcohol. My next experiment will be a "100 days without alcohol challenge", which I started on Sunday, March 13 (admittedly, I still drank a few beers after midnight on the night of Saturday to Sunday). Here too it is about raising awareness and changing ingrained habits. Just like Project Loffline, my experiences can be followed through my blogs.</p>
