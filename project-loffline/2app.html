            <h6>Project Loffline</h6>

            <p>The first few days without WhatsApp are over. And guess what; I survived! Nice, isn't it? Of course it takes some getting used to. In this blog I'll let you know how I liked the first few days, but first three reasons why I think we should make less use of our smartphones.</p>
            <p>At first, I believe that the use of smartphones is an obstacle to the development of social creativity. When we are sitting on a terrace with someone and we don't know what to say, we already feel a bit uncomfortable and we grap our phone to escape from that awkward feeling. We don't have to think about what else we can talk about. On the other hand I also think that because we already share so much with each other through the digital world, we also have less to tell each other when we actually meet. I'd say: let's just have that silence for once. In silence, people come up with the most ingenious ideas!</p>
            <p class = "blog-quote-right">We grap our phones to escape the awkwardness of silence</p>
            <p>Secondly, the use of smartphones makes for a less sharp memory. A phone as a digital agenda is some sort of external memory for us. Even if you have to ask someone about something, you can put it in a message and then forget about it. The memory becomes lazy. In the past, and I'm talking about hundreds, if not thousands, of years ago, people had to remember things by coming up with songs about them. And then there wasn't even always a pen and paper at hand to write it down! There are many more tricks to train your memory. Despite the fact that we may not need it as much as before, I think that a well-trained memory can come in very handy at some time.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I think that certain techniques also make us dependent. Take, for example, the navigation system, which is nowadays a standard function on almost every smartphone. We can drive anywhere by simply following the instructions. There is no map to be used anymore. You don't even need to know whether you're driving north or south. A while back I had to drive to Eindhoven. I decided to just print out a map of google maps and navigate by myself, just because I liked it. The result is that I could now drive to Eindhoven almost without navigation. I learned because I had to pay attention.</p>
            <p class = "blog-quote-left">As a human, I want to develop to my maximum potential</p>
            <p>What I have described above are all just personal hypotheses. Moreover, you can discuss about all these developments whether they are really "problematic developments". What does it matter if we lose certain human skills when technology solves it for us? My answer to that is that, as a human being, I want to develop to my maximum potential. I also want to live in the here and now and to be as independent of technology as possible. So a very personal answer, which does not end this discussion at all.</p>
            <p>Then there's the promised update on how I like my experiment so far. Every day I experience a few moments of complete emptiness. Probably those moments when the autopilot turns on and picks up my phone to check my messages. My brain then gets a system error, because it knows it won't find any messages on my phone. I've also had several moments when I wanted to ask someone a question. For example I wanted to quickly share something with my housemates. I couldn't, because I'm no longer part of the group chat. When I got home after visiting my parents, I realised that I had forgotten to ask something. I could have done that with a simple message.  Quickly asking in an app if I can borrow the car or if my friends have time to chill is no longer possible.</p>
            <p>All right, I miss WhatsApp a little bit. On the other hand, however, I do have a lot of time left over. I actually started reading a schoolbook spontaneously this week. I didn't even plan this for that day. Earlier I guess I  would have thankfully accepted the distracting of my phone. I also like starting and ending my day without a phone. That first hour of the day I now fill up with some yoga exercises, reading and, you'll never guess, breakfast! Doesn't sound very adventurous when I read it again, but definitely a lot more productive than reading all the overdue mail, groupchat-spam and a never ending amount of facebook updates. I also complete more of those little tasks you run into every day, but usually when it's just not the right time. One such thing is that I have a pair of shoes that I actually have to wax every two weeks to keep them tidy. In practice I did that once every six months or so. I usually didn't think about it until the moment I put them on to go out the door.</p>
            <p class = "blog-quote-right">I actually eat breakfast now</p>
            <p>So much for this update. The intention is that I will spend some of my remaining time on finding scientific articles on this theme. Of course I don't want to stop at my own thoughts. In my next blog I will first discuss how my ideas about the use of mobile phones have manifested themselves in the past two years.</p>
