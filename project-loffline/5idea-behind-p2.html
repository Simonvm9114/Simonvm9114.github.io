            <h1>The idea's behind - part 2</h1>
            <h6>Project Loffline</h6>

            <p>A while ago, part 1 of my the idea's behind this experiment could be read. I then went into some of the functions of the phone that I have been using less in recent years and why. In part two I discuss the experiences that eventually led me to start this experiment. To start with, I go back in time a few years.</p>     
            <p class = "blog-quote-right">Too lazy to find my charger and a socket I threw my phone somewhere in the tent</p>
            <p>In 2011 I went on holiday to Terschelling with some friends. At the time I had just bought my very first smartphone a few months ago. At the time I didn't even know what 3G and wifi meant. To my knowledge I just had internet on my phone, I was not so interested in how that worked. I remember that during that holiday my battery was already empty on the second day. Too lazy to find my charger and a socket I threw my phone somewhere in the tent. I didn't see it again for the rest of the week. A few times I wondered where it would be, because it was quite expensive. I didn't come to really looking for it, I always thought; well, it will float up again when we clean up the tent. This week went down as one of the best weeks in my whole life, if not the best.</p>  
            <p class = "blog-quote-left">It's almost a matter of course to contact the home front during the holidays</p>
            <p>In the vacations that followed, I did use wifi and mobile internet. The development of connectivity has gone very fast and on every street corner is now wifi to be found, even abroad. That makes it almost a matter of course to contact the home front during the holidays. This year I wanted to do that differently. My first attempt was at camp in Berlin. There was no wifi on our camping site, so that didn't make it a very difficult task to do without it. Were it not for the fact that I just had contact with this woman before that holiday, let's say she was quite special. Somehow I thought that a week of no contact would mean that she would have forgotten me afterwards. That was a very crazy thought, because that contact had been idle for more than half a year before. We just picked it up again. I was also afraid that she would make contact with me and that I could not respond immediately. Anyway, the result was that I was looking for wifi all the time and when I couldn't find it, I just used my mobile data (I didn't have a foreign bundle) to let her know about me. I had a nice week, but mission internetless was quite a failure. Even worse was how painfully it became clear to me how I was with my attention at many moments everywhere except in that beautiful Berlin and how that internet-dependent feeling influenced my actions.</p>  
            <p class = "blog-quote-right">there is a phobia called nomophobia: Fear of being unreachable</p>
            <p>Luckily, I had two vacations planned this year, so I got a second chance in October. Before the holidays my mother asked me if I would let her know when we arrived safely. I told her that I intended to use my phone only in emergencies, so she had to settle with "no message is good message". As understanding as my mother is, she accepted that answer. I didn't really have a battleplan, but it kind of went like this: When boarding the plane, I activated the flight mode. When I got off the plane I just left it on. My phone disappeared in a bedside table and during the whole week I took that flight mode off twice to see if I had received any messages of importance. However, both times my signal was not restored within a minute and I just stopped waiting. The flight mode went back on and the phone went back into the bedside table without me getting any wiser. Mission accomplished! So a week without a phone is possible. At home the world just kept turning, even when I was unreachable. On the day of homecoming, I was able to update all my overdue messages and mail.</p>  
            <p class = "blog-quote-left">The spreading of information through this medium is so easy and fast that it results in a lot of bullshit going back and forth</p>
            <p>This week without a phone gave me proof that there is a lot of fuss on a mobile phone that I can miss in daily life. In addition to these holiday experiences, I also follow a specialization in spirituallity. In this minor we are concerned with life issues that concern us. The experiences and related ideas about the use of mobile phones that I had gathered over the past few years coincided with this assignment in the week after that holiday in October. I realized that this is a subject that has been bothering me for a long time, and not just a little bit. I dedicated the report on my life questions entirely to this subject and the Loffline Project was also born. Apart from writing about the subject, I also wanted to put it into practice right away. In compiling the report, I searched the internet for information about the consequences of excessive telephone and internet use and addiction to telephone and internet. Yes, there is a diagnosis of internet addiction and there is a phobia called nomophobia: Fear of being unreachable. Research on the subject is still very scarce, so I haven't found many concrete consequences. I did find some nice tips to be more practical with my phone and to let it be less decisive in my actions. I will share a link to one of those articles right after this blog. When I started Project Loffline, I immediately put some of these tips into practice. For the removal of Whatsapp I was inspired by my former internship supervisor, for which I thank you. She is the only person I know who has never used Whatsapp, simply because she thinks she is reachable enough without using the chat application. In addition, the spreading of information through this medium is so easy and fast that it results in a lot of bullshit going back and forth. I particularly agree with this last argument.</p>  
            <p>So far, part two of my motivations to start Project Loffline. Parts one and two mainly contain experiences and ideas about aspects of the mobile phone use that I want to let go of. I also like to explain what I do want. So there will be a third and final part of the idea's behind in which I describe how I do like to see the world in front of me, of course with a link to the use of mobile phones. In it I will come back to that holiday in 2011. I'll dig deeper into what made this holiday so special.</p>
