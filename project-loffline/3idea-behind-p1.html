            <h1>The idea's behind - part 1</h1>
            <h6>Project Loffline</h6>

            <p>In the previous blog I mentioned that this time I would like to discuss my ideas about the use of mobile phones and how these ideas came about. In short, the idea's behind. Since there is a lot to tell about this, I divide it into three parts. In part 1 I talk about the reason why I started using certain functions of a phone differently, less or not at all anymore during the past two years.</p>
            <p class = "blog-quote-right">It drove me so crazy that I decided to turn off all beeps and buzzes</p>
            <p>The first function that I abandoned a long time ago is the buzz function and as many notifications as possible. I did this for the first time with WhatsApp, when my last relationship came to an end almost two years ago. You can imagine that this was not the happiest time of my life. Hoping that we would get back together sometime, I responded to almost every buzz of my phone in the first few days after, secretly hoping that it was her who was contacting me. Nothing was further from the truth. My phone kept disappointing me with reports that didn't matter at all to me at the time. It drove me so crazy that I decided to turn off all beeps and buzzes for WhatsApp. I also disabled the popups in my status bar. I actually had to open WhatsApp to see if I had any messages. After a while, I liked it so much that I disabled notifications from all the apps on my phone. Nowadays my phone only makes a sound when someone calls me. The only notifications are old-scool text messages and a missed calls. Oh yeah, and in soccer results of interesting matches. From the latter I'm still thinking about whether I really think it's necessary. At least I don't find these disturbing yet.</p>
            <p class = "blog-quote-left">Reading a message is a lot different from being able to answer a it</p>
            <p>I had already said goodbye to the "last seen function" of WhatsApp before the blue check marks were even there. In my opinion, this is a pure distillery. Reading a message is a lot different from being able to answer a it. What use is this information to us? Personally, I sometimes caught myself wondering if someone hadn't answered while they had read my message. Especially when I had just had a promising date with a girl that then no longer reacted to my messages. Disabling this function gave me the peace of mind of not getting any more information that was of no use to me or, even worse, wrongly made me convict someone of ignoring me.</p>
            <p class = "blog-quote-right">...ten minutes later I still didn't know what time it was</p>
            <p>The next thing I've stopped is using my phone to keep track of social media. I remember a year ago I wanted to fill up five minutes by scrolling through my facebook timeline. The next time I checked the time I was 45 minutes ahead. On days off, when I had a lot of good intentions (like cleaning, shopping, doing homework or doing fun things) I often started my day by looking at facebook in bed. Before I knew it I had already lost an hour of my day. Often with the result that I had to let go of at least one good intention. I remember from that time also something I call the "clock reflex". When I wanted to know what time it was and grabbed my mobile phone, I automatically clicked on the WhatsApp- and then on the Facebook icon. Another ten minutes further, sometimes I still didn't know what time it was.</p>
            <p>I have to admit that I really like Facebook and sometimes I find it useful too. I see a lot of funny movies or interesting articles and it's useful to plan a party or to keep a football team informed about the time everyone has to be present at the upcoming match. However, would my life be less complete if I sometimes miss something or only read it a day later? Absolutely not. That's why I think it's obsolete to have social media with you all day long. Removing the apps on my phone may be one of the best things I've ever done.</p>
            <p class = "blog-quote-left">Removing social media from my phone is the best thing I ever did</p>
            <p>Anyway, on to the next strap; games on the phone. Nowadays there are hundreds of millions of billions of games available for download in the Playstore. All for free, but if you want to be the best, you can also buy 5000 credits for â‚¬200,- today. And again tomorrow. As an adolescent, I spent a lot of time playing online games on the computer. I was pretty good at it too, if I may say so myself. I think I was also a bit addicted. Looking back on that, however, I do have the feeling that I used a lot of time for it, which I would have much rather spent on other things. Spending time with friends, for example. Going outside and discovering the world. From that experience, playing a game on my mini computer really feels like a waste of time. Yet, until recently, I still fell for it on a regular basis. I easily got tempted to download a game and before I know I wasted some hours before I concluded that I don't want to spend this much time on a game I can't win without spending all my savings anyway. As soon as I realised that I had gotten carried away again, I quickly deleted the game again. I intend to stop letting myself be seduced into playing games on my phone. Unless I'm sick in bed or something. Let's consider that an exception.</p>
            <p>So far part one the the idea's behind. At the end of this week it's two weeks since I started my experiment. A nice milestone for an update on how I like it. Of course later also parts 2 and 3 of my idea's behind will follow.</p>
