        <h1>Pilot</h1>
        <h6>Project Loffline</h6>

        <p>Today I decided to make some drastic changes in the use of my smartphone as an experiment. I named the
            experiment "Project Loffline". The title is based on the purpose of the experiment, which is to enjoy more
            of everything around me. The smells and colours of nature, a good conversation or a good book. The purpose
            of this experiment is also to find out which functions of a smartphone really is of a practical use. In my
            opinion there are a lot of functions that are fun and nice, but absolutely obsolete to have at your
            fingertips all day long. An example of this is social media. Great for when you're bored, but most of the
            times you stick to it much longer than anticipated and what would you really have missed if you hadn't
            watched a day on Facebook and Twitter? Instead, for example, I would much rather look outside while on the
            train or have a chat with a stranger. In short; enjoy everything that happens offline!</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-left">Most of the time you stick much longer to social media than anticipated</p>
        <p>One of the most important things I'm starting with is removing WhatsApp. Not because I think WhatsApp is by
            definition obsolete, but because I think that at least the way I use it has escalated out of control. I see
            the removal of WhatsApp as a kind of detox. Completely remove it to experience what I'm really going to miss
            about it. Earlier this year I already removed all social media from my phone. I like this very much and I'm
            going to leave it that way. From today I will switch off my phone an hour before I go to sleep until one
            hour after I wake up. This way I can start and end my day mindfull. Finally, I'm going to leave my phone at
            home at times when I'm going out. To start with, I'm going to do this once a week.</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-right">Are you satisfied with your smartphone use?</p>
        <p>Of course, this story doesn't come out of the blue. Of course there is also a personal story and a personal
            vision behind it. If you want to know more about it, keep an eye on my blogs. In the near future I will go
            deeper into my motives behind this experiment. Of course I will also keep you informed about how I like it!
            I am also very curious about the thoughts of others on this subject! So if you find this complete nonsense,
            don't hesitate to share it with me. Do you agree with me or do you recognize in yourself that you use your
            phone more than you would like, please share your experience with me. Are you wondering how to reach me now?
            Of course I can still be found and addressed via Facebook and calling is always allowed. If I don't answer,
            I have a wonderful voicemail where you can leave your message and I will call you back as soon as possible,
            of course when it suits me.</p>
        <p>For now I would like to invite you to watch the video <a class='link-in-article'

                    class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-xs"></i></a>. This video inspires me enormously and I hope you
            too!</p>
