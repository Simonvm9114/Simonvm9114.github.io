            <h1>Project What??</h1>
            <h6>Project Loffline</h6>

            <p>Hello everyone and welcome to a new episode of Project Loffline! Project what ???! Oja, project Loffline. Indeed, my last blog was already a while ago. In the meantime, I have been whatsapp-free for two months and as a result of this great project, I regularly leave my phone behind when I go out. It has given me some nice insights and some funny situations in recent weeks. Time for another update of my most recent experiences with the experiment.</p>
            <p class = "blog-quote-right">Through a medium where so much nonsense is spread, a simple confirmation that a message is understood is still too much to ask</p>
            <p>In the meantime, I have arrived at a point where I no longer miss whatsapp. I can reach everyone via SMS, and that remains, exactly to my liking, always nice and practical. If I need to know something about someone immediately, I will just call. If I do not need to know anything right away, I will send an SMS and I will see when they get back at me. If I want to chat with someone, I will do that via the Facebook chat on the computer, at a time and place that suites me. Still, I recently had a moment when I longed for Whatsapp. I opened the dishwasher at home and saw that it was completely packed, but not switched on. To my frustration, the place where the cutlery tray should be placed was packed with all kinds of cookware. I would like to express that frustration to all my housemates with a nice photo to urge everyone to pay attention to this from now on. However, when the frustration had subsided a bit, I thought how it would have been before if I touched on something similar via a group chat. Of my five housemates, there were often about two who answered that they had nothing to do with it the others didn’t even respond. Not really satisfactory that through a medium where so much nonsense is spread, a simple confirmation that a message is understood is still too much to ask. My conclusion: I can better address people personally. That also had the desired effect. Although I had to state the same thing four times, the felon understands the frustration and is going to pay attention to it from now on. My experience is that it is a lot harder to address people personally than via a text message. Via a text message, you can think about your responses. Addressing people, in the most general sense of the word, could be such a skill that we develop less as a result of the convenience of the mobile phone.</p>
            <p class = "blog-quote-left">I regularly forget to charge my phone now</p>
            <p>Besides removing whatsapp, I took some more measures to reduce my phone usage. These measures have also become very common for me in the meantime. I got used to it, but that didn't happen by itself. For example, I was annoyed that at the beginning and at the end of the day, I couldn't use my timer on the phone and couldn't listen to music or view my agenda, because my phone then "had to" turn off. These are some examples of functions that I see no harm in. I found the solution in Mallorca: The flightsave mode. Instead of turning off, I now put my phone in flightsave mode at night. I can still use offline functions without being distracted.</p>
            <p>Leaving my phone at home once a week has become a habit. I mainly choose moments when I am going out with friends. When I do have my phone with me, it is usually in my pocket or in another place out of reach. In fact, I always think before I go out the door whether I need it or not. Conversely, I also consider whether it can do any harm to be reachable. It is amazing how quickly this has caused my phone to receive considerably less attention, even when it is in my pocket, for example while going to the club (I would rather not leave it in my coat on the coat rack). Last weekend I realized on my way home that I didn't think about my phone for a moment during the entire evening, even though others still grap their phone regularly. The clock reflex (refer to The idea’s behind - part 1) has also disappeared. I had no idea what time it was all night. My phone receives so little attention that I had to search for it once. I had forgotten where I put it. I also regularly forget to charge it.</p>
            <p class = "blog-quote-right">Never before have I heard such a spontaneously surprised "Whaaaattt?"</p>
            <p>That last thing got me into a funny situation recently. When I was about to go to school I saw that my phone only had a little battery left. I decided to leave it at home to charge, because it would be of no use if it were to fall out. Once at the station, however, I realized that I had not checked my schedule at all. Usually I check in which class I have to be at the moment I enter the school building. A habit for which I needed my phone and which I was completely unaware of. I should also mention that I do not find this a nasty or wrong habit either. It's just handy. Anyway, I decided to ask someone on the train if I could use his or her phone to check my schedule. In the train there were two boys opposite me, both with earplugs. Because of those earplugs I felt quite uncomfortable to ask one of them, so I chose two ladies who were chatting on the other side of the path. I asked: "I left my phone at home and I forgot to check my schedule, may I use a phone to see which room I should be in?" I can tell you, I had never heard such a spontaneously surprised "Whaaaattt?" As this one. I repeated my question and, somewhat overwhelmed, one of the ladies asked which group I was in, so she could look it up for me. I was not allowed to do it myself. With hindsight, I can imagine that. It made me think about the amount of privacy that we actually carry with us with our phone. A universe of personal photos and messages and all that only behind a 4-digit pincode, which can be traced with your finger prints that you see when you hold the screen in the light. In any case, I have a whole new experience. I now often check my schedule in the morning and whether I take my phone with me or leave it at home, I write the classrooms where I need to be on my hand. That's even easier and faster, isn't it?</p>
            <p>That’s it for this time. I hope my blogs are still read with pleasure and your comments are still very welcome. I’d like to thank everyone who follows my blogs and has responded. I also still enjoy talking about the subject. The talking keeps me sharp on why exactly I’m doing these things.</p>
