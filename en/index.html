      <h1>My Story</h1>

      <p>
        Welcome — I’m glad you’re here. This page is meant to give future
        employers or collaborators a glimpse into who I am, how I work, and what
        guides the choices I make in my professional life. Think of it as a
        small journey through my values, my background, and the way I weave my
        work into my broader life path. If something here resonates with you, I
        invite you to read on.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Why I Work the Way I Do</h3>

      <p>
        After seven years of working as a data engineer, I’ve learned at least
        one thing: I want to spend my time on work that genuinely contributes to
        a meaningful life. Not that I’m planning to stop working, but I’ve
        become intentional about choosing work that supports a
        <strong>lifelong path</strong>. At 33, I finally know what I want to
        become “when I grow up”: a <strong>wisdom-keeper</strong> — an old man
        with insight. Not as a title, but as a direction, a lifelong project
        that shapes everything in my days.
      </p>

      <p>
        In practice, this means I’m available for up to
        <strong>18 hours of work per week</strong>, fully
        <strong>remote</strong>, with flexible working hours, and a minimum rate
        of <strong>€32.50 netto</strong>. Work that fits within this structure
        gives me the space to invest the rest of my time in personal growth,
        experimentation, reflection, and exploring new ideas. That is what
        creates energy, balance, and the possibility to realize my full
        potential — both professionally and personally.
      </p>

      <p>
        What I bring to the table is a unique combination of technical expertise
        and human understanding: seven years of experience in data engineering
        and BI (Python, Spark, SQL, Azure, Fabric, Qlik), web development
        (Python, Jinja, HTMX, MongoDB), and several years of experience in
        social work, personal development, and facilitating safe, connected
        workshops. I move comfortably between systems, data, and people — able
        to support operationally while also thinking along on a conceptual or
        visionary level.
      </p>

      <p>
        In short: I’m looking for work that allows me to contribute real value
        while also walking my path of wisdom. Work I can do with focus, clarity,
        and enjoyment — without attachment to status or extras. My primary
        intention is to earn a sustainable income; everything beyond that is a
        welcome bonus.
      </p>

        <a href="cv-en.html">my CV</a> or send me
        <a href="mailto:work.simonvm@outlook.com">an email</a>. From there, we
        can discover whether there’s a match — and who knows, perhaps we’ll soon
        share a cup of tea, virtually or otherwise.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Practical Notes</h3>

      <p>
        The mentioned hourly rate is a guiding estimate based on the minimum
        needed to cover my monthly expenses. I’m open to different forms of
        collaboration or employment; my preference depends on a few variables
        tied to the structure of the work. I typically spread my 16–18 hours
        over two or three days.
      </p>

      <p>
        Warm regards,<br />
        <strong>Simon</strong>
