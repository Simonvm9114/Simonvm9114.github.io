        <h6>100 Days Without Alcohol</h6>

        <p>On Sunday 13th of March 2016, I started on a new challange: 100 days without alcohol. This is, just like
            Project Loffline, a kind of social experiment of which I will write about my experiences in the coming
            period. In this introduction I will discuss what has brought me to this and what I hope I can achieve.</p>
        <p>Anyone who ever drinks alcohol will recognize themselves in waking up one morning (or afternoon (or evening))
            after having had a good party. Massively hungover as you are, there's not a chance of you doing anything
            usefull that day. I'm guessing that pretty much everyone who has ever experienced this, has also thought:
            "That drinking, it's useless, I quit". I'm one of those people. Those intentions not to drink anymore
            though, are often forgotten at the next opportunity to grab a beer.</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-right">Massively hungover as you are, there's not a chance of you doing anything usefull
            that day.</p>
        <p>As early as when I started on Project Loffline I knew that I also wanted to do something with (or about) my
            alcohol consumption. I just didn't know how and when. I didn't think it would be a good idea to change all
            things at once. Shortly after the start of Project Loffline, someone drew my attention to the blogs of a
            Belgian young man about my age. He tells his story about a hundred days without alcohol and I felt inspired
            by it. I knew since then that this would be my follow-up project. I've been looking forward to taking on
            this challenge for the past few months. Unfortunately for me this only resulted in me being only more
            annoyed by even the smallest hangovers. Now it has come to the point that I will really do a hundred days
            without alcohol, from 13 March till 20 June 2016.</p>
        <p>That end date wasn't just picked randomly of course. The summer starts on 21st of June and I like to have a
            refreshing beer on a sunny day. And that is a nice bridge to the goal of all this. The goal is not to stop
            drinking alcohol altogether. The goal is, just like with Project Loffline, to "detox". I use a hundred days
            without alcohol to eliminate habits I want to get rid of and then teach myself a way of dealing with alcohol
            that I like better, which I consider ideal. The way I see it now, the ideal is to drink a few drinks on
            occasion, because it tastes good. This instead of drinking countless beers, because supposedly everyone
            does.</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-left">Instead of drinking countless beers, because supposedly everyone does.</p>
        <p>So far, I haven't really been challenged. I haven't had a typical occasion since last week in which I would
            normally drink a lot. Of course I could avoid all parties for 100 days to make it as easy as possible for
            myself, but that's not the intention. I would also like to look for the occasions in which I would have to
            bite on my teeth and say no to some drinks. What I want to learn with this experiment, is to be able to
            switch to a party mood without alcohol. Of course I won't be able to do that if I crawl in a dark corner for
            a hundred days and wait until it's over. I would therefore like to offer myself as a party-taxi, on
            condition that there is a car available for me.</p>
        <p>I will keep you informed about my experiences and how I am doing with my blogs. I don't think it's going to
            be easy for me, so that's going to be interesting. I will also talk about what those habits are that bother
            me so much and let you in on my opinion about excessive use of alcohol lately. I'd like to hear everyone's
            opinion about this as well, so don't hesitate to leave a comment or a message!</p>
