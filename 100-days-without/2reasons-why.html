            <h1>The reasons why</h1>
            <h6>100 Days Without Alcohol</h6>

            <p>Long, long ago, alcohol was used to purify water. Clean tap water was not so self-evident in the time before Christ. Alcohol could be used to kill the bacteria that made people sick. Without any idea of extra effects it was invented with the best intension. Today, alcohol is still used in household cleaning products for example. Over the past centuries people started using it for other purposes too. You can no longer imagine a party without alcoholics. But what is that for? I firmly believe that this is not because we are so  damn thirsty during parties. So what is it for then? In think alcohol is associated with moments in which you have no obligations and want to relax. Also sometimes to deal with your emotions. Especially when you are in a bad mood. The amounts of alcohol flowing can be quite a lot. What it comes down to is that drinking alcohol is usually not an obligation. Rather, it is a way of spending your time off after a week of hard working.</p>
            <p class = "blog-quote-right">Are we really so damn thirsty during parties?</p>
            <p>Nice story, Simon, but why exactly those hundred days without alcohol? Well let me explain this. In recent years I have started to ask myself questions about the use of alcohol. Why is it necessary to drink so much? I have already been able to formulate an answer to that question for myself: relax, release and deal with emotions. But can it be done differently? That's my next question. Do I necessarily need alcohol to relax and release? Maybe there are other things I can do to boost myself a bit when I need that. So I wonder if I can get all that alcohol gives me in a different way.</p>
            <p class = "blog-quote-left">Do I necessarily need alcohol to relax and release?</p>
            <p>The main reason I do this, is because alcohol is just bad for you. Especially in large quantities. With this detox I try to force myself to find other ways. For example, I hope to be able to have more fun at parties without needing alcohol to get loose. Besides that I have some reasons to want to avoid alcohol. Some reasons are just irritations that I experience for years now. For example, I can be extremely annoyed by people who are suddenly very nice to me when they are drunk. People who propose that we should hang out together some time, but then I never hear anything about it again. As of today I think I know a little bit why people do this. I've probably even been guilty of it myself.</p>
            <p>In my next blog I'll talk about other reasons why I want to drastically reduce my use of alcohol. Of course I'm still curious about what others think about this subject. Do you agree with me or do you have a totally different opinion? Please share it with me.</p>
