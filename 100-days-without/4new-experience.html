        <h6>100 Days Without Alcohol</h6>

        <p>100 days without alcohol have almost come to an end. It has been a very interesting period for me so far.
            Luckily there haven't been many times when I've had a hard time with it. In this blog I discuss the most
            striking events and findings. From small annoyances to beautiful moments.</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-right">Only once I caught myself having an urge to a beer</p>
        <p>I'll start with my physical condition. The most remarkable thing is of course that after a good night of
            party I'm not hungover. What also caught my attention, and what I didn't expect, is that my rhythm doesn't
            get disturbed at all if I party untill late without alcohol. At first I had the feeling that I slept shorter
            when I had been drinking a lot (whether I got out of bed or not, that's another matter). So this turns out
            not to be so bad. Apart from the fact that I'm never hungover again, I don't feel significantly healthier in
            general daily life. A little maybe, but I suspect that this is also affected by the fact that I have been
            more aware of what I eat lately.</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-left">drinking beer had become a goal of it's own</p>
        <p>Only once during this challange I caught myself having an urge to a beer. That was when me and my graduation
            partner had hoped to be able to hand in our research after weeks of hard work on a Friday. Unfortunately we
            weren't finished yet. The sun was shining on that day. When I stepped out of the station hall on my way
            home, I really felt like having a beer. At first I couldn't really explain this. Normally this could also be
            a day when I would have a beer in the evening. I started to think about it and I came to the conclusion that
            I just wanted to relax for a bit.</p>
        <p>Strictly speaking, beer is not directly related to relaxation. By this I mean relaxation is not an undisputed
            consequence of drinking beer. My brain has probably made a link between relaxation and drinking beer. Given
            the situations in which I have been drinking beer in the past and the effects of beer on your brain, that is
            not even a strange association at all. Because of the association, however, I skip a step in my thinking. In
            the situation described, drinking beer had become a goal of it's own. While the underlying desire was
            relaxation. If relaxation is my goal, I can of course choose to drink a beer (or 8) as a remedy, but there
            will undoubtedly also be other options. If I then opted for beer, this choice would be a lot more conscious
            already. And that's exactly what I want to achieve, consious decisions.</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-right">If I was drunk, my body might not have bothered me as much.</p>
        <p>In the previous post I already wrote about the first real challenge; Freshtival. I can tell you. I had a
            wonderful day. Not in the least because Max Verstappen became the first ever Dutch Formula 1 driver to win a
            Grand Prix. Anyway, that's not what I'm writing about here. I guess it took me about an hour during
            freshtival to warm up. I felt a bit uncomfortable and just moved a bit with the music. I noticed that when I
            just move a little bit with the music, I loosen up more and more. By enjoying the music, the nice
            atmosphere, the many people and the dancing I came to a sort of trance as the evening progressed, in which
            it doesn't really matter how crazy you act anymore. Just to clear up any misunderstandings; I hadn't taken
            any other drugs either. The people with whom I was there, I think, also have a big influence on that. I
            later realised that if I had been there accompanied by some boring people, I wouldn't really get loose
            myself. At the same time I also realized that in that case it wouldn't matter if I would let myself get
            completely filled with alcohol. The main difference I noticed with when I would have been drunk, is that I
            got tired a bit faster now. If I had drunk, my body might not have bothered me as much. Correction; I
            probably wouldn't have given in to the signals of my body as quickly. I was at freshtival from 18.30 till
            0:00h. I really enjoyed it, but honestly I thought it was long enough.</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-left">Another drink that gets me through the challenge is beer. Huh, beer? Yes, beer!</p>
        <p>During Freshtival I only consumed water and energy drink. Normally I'm not a big fan of energy drinks, but
            sometimes I make an exception. Another drink that gets me through the non-alcohol challenge is beer. Huh,
            beer? Yes, beer. Alcohol-free beer. Truly a great invention. You have all these nice flavours now to choose
            from and if you drink non-alcoholic beer from the bottle, it even feels as if you're not that much of an
            outsider. The experience of drinking beer out of a glass can't be equalled with non-alcoholic beer though. I
            tried this, but it's like drinking a glass of soda. Alcohol-free beer is in any case much better than, for
            example, cola. You're really fed up with that after 2 or 3 glasses. I haven't had the feeling that I'm
            really an outsider without beer yet. People generally know what I'm doing and I don't feel like I'm out of
            tune. Among my regular friends there are also a number of fanatical athletes who sometimes don't want to
            drink either. We can be a team and support each other a bit.</p>
        <p>I'm often asked what I'm going to do on day 101? I don't get a chance to answer. "You're proberbly going to
            make up for all the beer you've missed in the past hundred days, won't you?". The fact that people make this
            assumption in is sometimes a bit annoying. Most assumption that people make about after my hundred days
            imply that not drinking alcohol would be a huge loss for me. Illustrative for that was my father's birthday
            present. He gave me a beers pack and he called it "the redemption". The fact that he gave me another packet
            of non-alcoholic beer after that made it a nice joke. It is clear that missing the alcohol is not an issue.
            The only thing I sometimes find difficult when dealing with people who are drinking is that they have a
            completely different perception of things. People who have been drinking are laughing at things that are not
            so funny from my sober point of view. Also drunk people are very slow. On the other hand, drunk people with
            the disturbed locomotion and their sense of drama can also be very entertaining and you'll get to laugh
            about that more when you're sober yourself.</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-right">Drunk people are very slow</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I know what I'm going to do on day 101. This one will also be alcohol free. Just like days 102 to
            150. I have decided to extend my non-alcoholic period by 50 days. I do this because in the first half of my
            hundred days I have had few challenges. Because of a surgery in the first week of my challenge I didn't
            really have the opportunity to celebrate a party like I would otherwise do. This gives me the impression
            that I am not yet where I want to be. The new end date for this project will be August 11th.</p>
