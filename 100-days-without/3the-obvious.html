        <h6>100 Days Without Alcohol</h6>

        <p>I would like to start this post with a warning. Dear readers, if you want to learn something today, you
            better read something else. Today I'm going to explain why I want to reduce my alcohol consumption. In my
            previous post, I already made the following statement: Alcohol is bad for you and your body. It affects
            several organs, such as your brain and liver. It also affects your skin. For example, your skin ages faster
            due to excessive alcohol consumption, but smashing your head against the sidewalk when you fall off your
            bike is certainly not good for skin either. This is probably no news to anyone. The rest of the reasons I
            give in this post to why I reduce my alcohol consumption may be just as obvious. Yet we all seem to ignore
            most of these quite good reasons. How often do you hear someone proudly tell you what a mega hangover they
            had after that last night's party? I think it's pretty crazy sometimes, how satisfied someone looks back
            after he or she has professionally terrorized the body again. And to think that without that body, with all
            its thousands of specific functions, we wouldn't even have been able to lift a beer. Reason number one for
            me to cut back on alcohol is that I want to be more careful with my body.</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-right">Smashing your head against the sidewalk is certainly not good for the sensitive skin
        </p>
        <p>When you drink alcohol, you do or say things you wouldn't otherwise. Your boundaries change and so do your
            standards. You behave different when your a bit tipsy. My second reason for reducing alcohol is that I don't
            want my boundaries and my behaviour to be determined by something I consume. Because why do we want to
            behave so differently? When I speak for myself, I think of myself as a kind of improved version when I'm
            drunk. I feel more relaxed and spontaneous. I think I'm funnier and have more guts. All in all, I feel less
            inhibited by insecurity, simply because I don't care about how people around me see me. In this case, I
            think it's much more effective to investigate why I do care how people around me see me at all. It certainly
            takes a lot more time (maybe a hundred days isn't enough in that respect), but it can help me to permanently
            find that improved version of myself.</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-left">I don't want my boundaries and behaviour to be determined by something I consume</p>
        <p>I just mentioned that drinking alcohol makes me feel more relaxed and more confident in social situations.
            For example at a party. According to Berthold Gunster (2014) this is a form of ineffective thinking.
            Ineffective thinking means that a solution to your problem only makes the problem worse. In this case, the
            insecurity or tension in social situations is the problem and alcohol the solution. It works as follows: For
            example, you use alcohol during parties to feel relaxed or more confident. However, the effect of this is
            only temporary. At the next party you want to feel relaxed again, so you take alcohol. Because you might get
            used to the effect of alcohol, you will need more and more for the same effect in the future. The use of
            alcohol (your solution) only makes you more tense or insecure (your problem) when you can't use it. This
            creates dependence on a drug. There is a temporary solution, but the problem is not solved. It just comes
            back in the next similar situation. My third reason for temporarily stopping alcohol is to break this
            vicious circle. I want to learn what makes me insecure in certain situations and start working on that.</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-right">Because you might get used to the effect of alcohol, you will need more and more for
            the same effect in the future</p>
        <p>Finally, most of the times, alcohol doesn't even give me the desired effect anyway. When I was young and
            careless, when I had no idea what alcohol was doing to me, I didn't really have any expectations of it. That
            always works better. In the meantime I have some years of experience and I know a bit what to expect.
            Unfortunately I always hope for a recurrence of my best memories. That leeds me to a lot of disappointment
            and to my regret the hangover is no less. Over the years I have noticed that alcohol mainly strengthens my
            mood, It doesn't change it. So when I'm not feeling very well, alcohol won't change that either. I have the
            impression that the positive effect of alcohol is more dependent on your mood prior to the first beer. The
            people that accompanied me and simple things like the weather have been a much more reliable indicator for
            an unforgettable night than the amount of alcohol I drank. On the days of my most beautiful adventures, the
            weather had almost always been good. Something new, a spontaneous idea or an unexpected turn of events is
            also part of the best nights.</p>
        <p class="blog-quote-left">simple things like the weather have been a much more reliable indicator for an
            unforgettable night</p>
        <p>I've been on the road for about 60 days now in my 100 days without alcohol challenge. My expectation is that
            the challenge will be a lot bigger in the second half. Because of surgery I haven't really been able to
            party anyway. My body just couldn't do that. The first real challenges were yesterday's freshtival and next
            week I'll be celebrating my own birthday, which normally included some beers. Besides, the weather is
            already quite summery. My upcoming post will involve my experiences with parties without alcohol.</p>
