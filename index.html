            <h1>About me - Simon van Meegdenburg</h1>

            <p>My name is Simon van Meegdenburg and I'm a data passionate. Ever since I was a kid, I've been crazy about figures, statistics and analyzing stuff. 
                I remember as the day of yesterday that my mother made an excelsheet for me so that I could keep track of the standings of the Formula 1 World Championship. 
                I could stare at it for hours and fantasize about how my favorite driver would have to perform in order to win the championship. </p>

            <p>We are a few years ahead in time and instead of the excelsheet I now stare at the Formula 1 app on my phone. That fantasizing has remained the same. 
                So it's no wonder that besides data passionate I can now also call myself a data professional. A field and a hobby for which I get up every day with a little dance. 
                I like to spend my time learning new programming tricks or watching clips about the latest trends in the world of data.</p>

            <p>The creation of this website is another thing I did because I enjoy creating things with computers. I also find it a great way to show more of myself to the outside world. 
                This website contains everything I think you should know about me. You can read about my working experience and the knowledge I gained through different studies, books and courses.
                Also you can read about my <a class = 'link-in-article' href="blog-carreerswitch.html">career switch<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-xs"></i></a> in my latest blogpost. Additionally there are some good old blogpost I wrote a couple of years ago. Those were originally written in my native language and are now translated to English.
                You can find all of this under the 'content' button on the top-right of this page. Last but not least I'm working on a collection of Youtube video's. You can watch the latest one down below.</p>
