        <h1>About me - Simon van Meegdenburg</h1>

        <p>My name is Simon van Meegdenburg and I'm a data passionate. Ever since I was a kid, I've been crazy about
            figures, statistics and analyzing stuff.
            I remember as the day of yesterday that my mother made an excel sheet for me so that I could keep track of
            the standings of the Formula 1 World Championship.
            I could stare at it for hours and fantasize about how my favorite driver would have to perform in order to
            win the championship. </p>

        <p>We are a few years ahead in time and I can now spent hours experimenting with an API filled with data for all
            events in the history of Formula 1.
            So it's no wonder that besides data passionate I can now also call myself a data professional.
            I like to spend my time learning new programming tricks or watching clips about the latest trends in the
            world of data.</p>

        <p>This website was a result of me learning my first steps in webdevelopment back in 2019. Another thing I did
            because I enjoy creating things with computers. I also find it a great way to show more of myself to the
            outside world.
            Here you find everything I think you should know about me. You can read about my working experience and the
            knowledge I gained through different studies, books and courses.
            Also you can read about my <a class='link-in-article' href="blog-carreerswitch.html">career switch<i
                    class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-xs"></i></a> back in 2018. Besides data, I'm also interested in
            all things around personal growth.
            You'll find blogposts I wrote back in 2015/16 about some social experiments I tried. Those were originally
            written in my native language and are now translated to English.
            You can find all of this under the 'content' button on the top-right of this page. The knowledge section
            also contains some hints about my interest in personal growth.</p>
